            <h3>Who we are!</h3>
            <p>We are 3 HTL-Leonding students, who want to make a betting and news website for our WMC school project.</p>
            <p>We split the tasks so everyone is doing something important:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Alberto Sacilotto: back-end and website-designer</li>
                <li>Arsim Saliu: front-end and website-designer</li>
                <li>Yanis Ferecean: front-end, back-end and logodesigner</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="m-3">
            <h3>What are the contents of the website?</h3>
            <p>The Website is all about the premier league and some other features like: </p>
            <ul>
                <li>A "Betting" section where you can bet without money (website-currency-betting)</li>
                <li>A "Fantasy League" section where you can have your own 15 players bought with the website-currency</li>
                <li>A "News" section where you can see some of the most interesting news in the premier league</li>
            </ul>
