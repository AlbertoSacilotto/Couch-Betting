Couch Betting
* Project Name: Couch Betting 
* Goals: We want to make a website with a fully functional football-betting system, footballnews website with an integrated Fantasy League System without needing to pay for anything. Our targeted audience are people who are interested in football or betting but cant bet with real money or just people who want to read some footballnews.

* Parts

** static part: We are going to use HTML and CSS for our Website and for its design. The Website will be white themed with black text. The first thing you will see when you open the website will be our Logo and some options like news, fantasy league and other betting options.

** dynamic part: We will have a login system made with NodeJS and the news and the scores will be taken from other websites with API's

* Risks and Showstoppers: Scores wont be able to be shown live and the API could not work properly.

* Deadlines: --

** Website design and contents: We want to have the static part done by the first semester which in cludes the HTML, CSS and the descriptions of the options.

** We want to make the login system by the 3rd of March

** The Web API for the news should be made by 4th of April

** The Web API for the scores should be made by the 20th of April

** __we still need to find out with what we will be working with for the other tasks__

* Members and their tasks

** Alberto: Backend and website-design

** Arsim: Frontend and website-design

** Yanis: Frontend, Backend and Logodesign

** Teamleader: We have decided that it would be the best that the lead changes each week so no one does too much or too less.
