=== Couch Betting
* Project Name: Couch Betting 
* Description: We want to make a website with a fully functional football-betting system, footballnews website with an integrated Fantasy League System without needing to pay for anything. Our targeted audience are people who are interested in football or betting but cant bet with real money or just people who want to read some footballnews.
* Goals: We want to learn how to work with HTML, Typescript, API's and other things that will help us in the future as Software Developers and Coders

=== Parts

* static part: We are going to use HTML and CSS for our Website and for its design. Our website will have a blue color scheme with black and a lot of pictures. We will have a Info section in which we will display the basic Information of our website and about our other sections like betting and fantasy league. There will be a betting/fantasy league section in which we will describe the Game modes properly.

* dynamic part: We will have a login system made with NodeJS. We will work with Typescript for our more basic dynamic parts and we will use Web API's to take Information from other Websites like News which we cant to on ourselves.

* Risks and Showstoppers: Scores wont be able to be shown live and the API could not work properly.

=== Deadlines:

* Website design and contents: We want to have the static part done by the first semester which in cludes the HTML, CSS and the descriptions of the options.

* We want to make the login system by the 3rd of March

* The Web API for the news should be made by 4th of April
